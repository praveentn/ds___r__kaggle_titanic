# PROBLEMS

I) For a given Mean 494 and standard deviation = 100 <br/>
1. What is the probability that a randomly selected score is between 600 and its mean. <br/>
2. What is the probability of obtaining a score more than 700. <br/>
3. Score that is less than 550. <br/>
4. Score between 300 and 600. <br/>

II) Suppose during any hour in large departmental store, the average number of shoppers is 448, <br/>
with the standard deviation of 21 shoppers. What is the probability that a random sample of 49 <br/>
different shopping hours will yield a sample mean between 441 and 446 shoppers. <br/>
