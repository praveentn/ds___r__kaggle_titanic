# PROBLEM
Mercury makes a 2.4 lt V-6 engine, The Laser XRi, used in speedboats. 
The company's engineer believe that the engine delivers an average power of 220 horsepower
and that the standard deviation of power delivered is 15 horsepower. 
A potential buyer intends to sample 100 engines(each engine to be run a single time). 
What is the probability that the sample mean will be less than 217 horsepower?
