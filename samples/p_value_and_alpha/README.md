# PROBLEM

An automatic bottling machine fills cola into 2 lt (2000 cm3) bottles. A consumer advocate wants to test the null hypothesis that the average amount filed by the machine into the bottle is at least 2,000 cm3. A random sample of 40 bottles coming out of the machine was selected and the exact content of the selected bottles are recorded. The sample mean was 1,999.6 cm3. The population standard deviation is known from the past experience to be 1.30 cm3.
