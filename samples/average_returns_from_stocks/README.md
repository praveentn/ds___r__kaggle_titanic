# PROBLEM

A stock market analyst wants to estimate the average return on a certain stock. A random sample of 15 days yields an average (annualized) return of Xbar=10.37% and a standard deviation of s=3.5%. Assuming a normal population of returns, give a 95% confidence interval for the average return on this stock.
